## 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a Frontend Developer with hands-on experience building real-world web applications, dashboards, and interactive tools.  
I enjoy working on projects where **UI complexity, performance, and maintainability** matter.

One of my main areas of experience is developing **visual and node-based interfaces** (similar to workflow or diagram editors), where clean architecture and a good user experience are essential.

I care about writing clean code, structuring projects properly, and building interfaces that are easy to extend and maintain.
